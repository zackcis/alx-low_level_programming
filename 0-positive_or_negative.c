 * Description: This program will assign a random number to the variable
 * n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print
 * whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
 *
 * You can find the source code here
 * The variable n will store a different value every time you will run
 * this program
 * You donâ€™t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do
 * not touch this code
 * The output of the program should be:
 * The number, followed by
 * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
 * if the number is 0: is zero
 * if the number is less than 0: is negative
 * followed by a new line
 * Return: 0 (success) and 1 (failure) to execute
